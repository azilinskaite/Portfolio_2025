      <p>
      Beginner Front-End developer currently studying at Hyper Island in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm excited about building creative digital projects and enjoy the challenge of problem-solving. With over six years of experience in the fashion design field, I've developed a strong ability to combine technical and creative thinking. Currently, I'm looking forward to opportunities that will allow me to deepen my skills and apply them in real-world projects. I'm eager to explore how my diverse background can contribute to innovative projects!
